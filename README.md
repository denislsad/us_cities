In this project, I create a table with information about metropolitan areas in the United States. For simplicity, they will just be called "cities". After finding the data in open sources, I clean it if necessary and load it one by one with a simple custom function. Along the way, I explain the methodology for each metric and what it means. The data set can be found on this project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/denislsad/us_cities) and on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/denissad/us-cities). In the second part of the project, I explore the variables I find most interesting and their relationship to each other through visualization and testing.
The variables are:
- Population,
- Average Rental Price,
- Median Rental Price,
- Unemployment Rate,
- Per Capita Income,
- Air Quality,
- Walk, Transit, and Bike Scores, 
- Cost of Living,
- Price Parity,
- Median Commute Time,
- Latitude, Longitude.
